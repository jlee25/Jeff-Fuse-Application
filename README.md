## Basic Weather App using React and React-Redux

This is my Fuse application. A very basic Weather App that shows weather information.

A couple of notes:

- I did not want to go over the time limit that was suggested. So I wanted to be honest and build it within the time period.
- I implemented geolocation so it can determine the weather wherever you are situated in.
- Not Mobile Ready. Will be built for mobile as soon as possible!
- Very basic css. I did not want to spend most of my time with styling. I wanted to spend more time on functionality.
- Heroku uses https while the Openweather Map Api uses http. I had some cors issues but if you put the following in front of the URL 
  https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com it will work!
